"""
Atomic JSON serialization — Emu-A4 pattern.

Writes to a tempfile in the same directory, fsyncs, then renames atomically.
Appends are line-oriented (jsonl) with O_APPEND + fsync. No partial writes,
no torn reads, stdlib only.

Also provides a reader that tolerates in-flight writes by retrying on
JSONDecodeError once.
