> **An @enchanter-ai product — algorithm-driven, agent-managed, self-learning.**

**8 plugins. 5 named engines. 10 git hosts. 10 CI systems. 15 slash commands. Zero runtime deps.**

Built from the commit log of teams that ship: every flow exists because someone, somewhere, force-pushed their career off the edge.

> You edit three files. Sylph watches via `PostToolUse(Edit|Write)`.

Sylph is the git workflow layer you wrote yourself, if you'd had three months and a production-incident scar.

## TL;DR

**In plain English:** You asked Claude to fix the bug. You did not ask to write the commit message, branch the changes, draft the PR, and pick the reviewers. Sylph handles all of it — the way you would have.

**Technically:** W2 Jaccard-Cosine Boundary Segmentation clusters edit events online (`d = α·(1−jaccard) + β·(1−cosine) + γ·tanh(idle/τ)`, θ=0.55) to detect task boundaries without human input; W1 Myers-Diff Conventional Classifier drafts Conventional Commits messages validated by Haiku against the spec; W3 Workflow-Pattern Classifier picks the branch strategy from a weighted decision tree over branch-age, protection rules, and tag cadence. W5 Gauss Learning accumulates per-developer preferences (branch naming, reviewer overrides, W2 threshold corrections) across sessions with a bootstrap floor of 10 samples.

---

## Origin

**Sylph** takes its name from **Ars Nouveau** — a wind elemental that tends the world's flora, threading air currents between distant points and carrying seeds across long distances to stitch the landscape together. Every branch is a thread; every merge stitches threads into history; every PR asks *does this fit the pattern?*

The question this plugin answers: *How does this ship?*

## Who this is for

- Teams working across multiple git hosts / CI systems who want one tool that speaks all of them — GitHub + GitLab + Bitbucket + the rest — via a single adapter contract.
- Engineers who've force-pushed their career off the edge once and want the destructive-op gate to catch the next one before it runs.
- Developers tired of manually classifying workflow (GitFlow vs. trunk vs. stacked) and having tools assume GitHub Flow — Sylph classifies before it acts.

Not for:

- Solo repos where you already know every command by muscle memory — Sylph's value scales with team size and host diversity.
- Teams who want a tool that **triggers** builds — Sylph reads CI, never triggers builds. CI execution belongs to your existing CI pipelines.

---

## How It Works

Sylph runs inside your Claude Code session and drives git on your behalf:

- **Watches every edit.** PostToolUse hooks feed W2 Jaccard-Cosine boundary segmentation. Logical tasks get clustered automatically.
- **Scaffolds branches.** W3 detects your workflow (GitHub Flow / Trunk-Based / GitFlow / Release Flow / Stacked Diffs) and names branches to match (`feat/x`, `feature/x`, `user/x`, bare-topic).
- **Drafts commits.** W1 Sonnet drafts a Conventional Commits message; Haiku + Python stdlib validate format + policy; SSH/GPG signed; DCO sign-off if the repo wants it.
- **Opens PRs.** W4 ranks reviewers (blame × recency × CODEOWNERS × availability), composes a 4-section body from W2 cluster + Crow V4 continuity, dispatches to the right host adapter.
- **Reads CI.** ci-reader normalizes check runs from 10 systems. Never triggers a build itself — Sylph is a git-workflow plugin; CI execution belongs to your existing CI pipelines.
- **Merges.** Strategy inferred from workflow; merge-queue-enqueues where configured.
- **Guards destructive ops.** sylph-gate intercepts `PreToolUse(Bash)` — force-push / filter-branch / clean -fdx / rebase-i-of-pushed etc. route through a Crow-style decision-gate before they can run.
- **Learns.** W5 Gauss EMA adapts priors per-developer. Past sample 10, the defaults give way to what you actually do.

## What Makes Sylph Different

### It clusters the edit stream, not the commit stream

W2 Jaccard-Cosine Boundary Segmentation runs on `PostToolUse(Edit|Write)` — *before* commits exist. Distance `= α·(1−jaccard(files)) + β·(1−cosine(tokens)) + γ·tanh(idle/τ)`. At θ=0.55, a coherent task closes and the commit+PR logic fires. No timer-based batching, no manual `git add` discipline — just "did I finish a logical thing?"

### Every git host speaks the same contract

10 hosts, 1 `HostAdapter` contract: token resolution → authenticated request → normalized `PullRequest` return. Same `_rest.api_request` call path for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud / Data Center, Azure DevOps, Gitea, Forgejo, Codeberg, AWS CodeCommit, and SourceHut. When one host's JSON shape changes, exactly one file moves.

### Destructive ops route through a Crow-style gate

`git push --force`, `git rebase -i <pushed-ref>`, `git clean -fdx`, `git filter-branch` — every destructive pattern routes through sylph-gate before it can run. Recovery windows documented per op; `clean -fdx` has zero; force-push to protected branches has zero bypass. No accidental career-enders.

### It learns per-developer, not per-repo

W5 Gauss Learning EMA runs per `(developer, surface)`. After 10 samples, the defaults give way to what you actually do — commit-subject verbosity, kebab vs. snake branch-name preferences, reviewer override patterns, W2 threshold corrections.

## The Full Lifecycle

A tool call flows through Sylph in five stages top-to-bottom: **SessionStart** (Haiku) loads the provider registry via `capability-memory`; **PreToolUse(Bash)** (Haiku) gates destructive ops via `sylph-gate`; **PostToolUse(Edit|Write)** (Sonnet) clusters edits via W2 Jaccard-Cosine boundary segmentation; on boundary close, the **commit + PR** stage (Sonnet) runs W3/W1/W4 to auto-branch, auto-commit, and open a draft PR with ranked reviewers; **PreCompact** (Sonnet) persists developer preferences via W5 Gauss Learning. The orthogonal `ci-reader` poll feeds W4's merge-queue gate.

## Install

Two commands in Claude Code + one per project:

```
/plugin marketplace add enchanter-ai/sylph
/plugin install full@sylph
```

Then, from inside the repo you want to use Sylph on:

```
/sylph:setup
```

`/sylph:setup` is the **auto-configurator**: it runs `git remote get-url origin`, maps the URL to one of the 10 supported hosts, and does **only** the work that host needs — auto-installing the right tool via your platform's package manager (`winget` on Windows, `brew` on macOS, `apt`/`dnf`/`pacman` on Linux) and walking you through exactly one token prompt when required. No manual shell steps. No forced `gh` install if you're on GitLab.

If you skip setup entirely, Sylph runs in degraded mode — commit drafting + W2 task-boundary clustering + the destructive-op gate all work without any host credentials. Only PR opening / merging needs the host token.

<details>
<summary>What `/sylph:setup` does per host</summary>

| Host | What gets configured |
|---|---|
| GitHub | Uses the existing git-credential-manager token if present (the same one that authorizes `git push`). Otherwise offers to install `gh` + run `gh auth login`. |
| GitLab | Prompts for a PAT (api + write_repository scopes), stores via `git credential approve`. Handles self-managed via prompted api_base. |
| Bitbucket Cloud | Prompts for a Repository Access Token (App Passwords are deprecated). |
| Bitbucket Data Center | Prompts for api_base + HTTP PAT. |
| Azure DevOps | Prompts for PAT (Code + Pull Request scopes), org, project. |
| Gitea / Forgejo / Codeberg | Prompts for api_base + PAT. |
| AWS CodeCommit | Auto-installs `aws` CLI if missing; runs `aws configure` if no IAM identity resolves. |
| SourceHut | Configures the project's mailing-list address + `git send-email` OR SMTP credentials. |

</details>

---

## Quickstart

Install, probe the host, commit. Sixty seconds:

```
/plugin install full@sylph
/sylph:setup
/sylph:commit
```

Expected: `/sylph:setup` classifies your host + CI + auth in one pass, prompting only for a token when needed. `/sylph:commit` drafts a Conventional Commits message from the staged diff (W1 Sonnet + Haiku validate), signs it, and commits — without you touching `git commit -m`. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for the full first-PR walkthrough.

## 8 Plugins, 5 Agents, 15 Commands

| Plugin | Command(s) | What | Agent (tier) |
|--------|-----------|------|--------------|
| capability-memory | `/sylph:setup` | SessionStart: probe git host + CI + provider registry; cache capabilities | — (hook + skill) |
| boundary-segmenter | — (hook-only) | PostToolUse: W2 Jaccard-Cosine clusters edits into task boundaries | boundary-detector (Opus) |
| branch-workflow | `/sylph:branch`, `/sylph:workflow-detect` | Scaffold branches matching the W3-classified workflow | — (skill) |
| commit-intelligence | `/sylph:commit` | W1 Myers-Diff conventional-commits draft + policy validation + signing | commit-drafter (Sonnet), message-validator (Haiku) |
| pr-lifecycle | `/sylph:pr`, `/sylph:status`, `/sylph:reviewers`, `/sylph:merge`, `/sylph:close`, `/sylph:release`, `/sylph:revert` | PR open / monitor / merge / release / revert | conflict-resolver (Opus), pr-description-crafter (Opus) |
| ci-reader | `/sylph:ci-status`, `/sylph:retry-ci` | Normalize check runs across 10 CI systems; read-only | — |
| sylph-gate | `/sylph:dry-run` | PreToolUse(Bash) advisory gate for destructive ops | — (hook) |
| sylph-learning | `/sylph:learnings` | W5 Gauss EMA per-developer preference adaptation | — |

**Agent tier spread:** 3 Opus (boundary-detector, conflict-resolver, pr-description-crafter), 1 Sonnet (commit-drafter), 1 Haiku (message-validator) — orchestration on Opus, execution on Sonnet, validation on Haiku. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the tiering contract.

**Operational skills (above the 15 workflow commands):** `/sylph:stats` (per-plugin metrics), `/sylph:audit` (sylph-gate decision log), `/sylph:audit-pdf` (HTML + dark-themed PDF export; PDF best-effort via wkhtmltopdf / chromium / chrome / msedge), `/sylph:discard` (reset a stuck W2 cluster), `/sylph:gate-check` (pre-flight PR gate probe), `/sylph:review-boundary` (Opus boundary-detector escalation when W2 confidence < 0.7). Surfaces the hooks' internal state without widening the auto-orchestration surface.

Footnote: `audit-pdf` produces HTML as the primary artifact (always succeeds); PDF conversion is best-effort via available headless browsers — see [commands/audit-pdf.md](plugins/sylph-learning/commands/audit-pdf.md).

## What You Get Per Session

Four hook events fan out into six color-coded journals — one per sub-plugin whose state actually persists — and converge on the enchanted-mcp bus plus the 15-command query surface (plus 6 operational skills listed above). Color maps engines to journals: blue = boundary-segmenter (W2) · amber = capability-memory · red = sylph-gate · yellow = commit-intelligence + pr-lifecycle (W1 + W4) · purple = sylph-learning (W5). The event chain now wires end-to-end: `boundary-segmenter` → `branch-workflow` + `commit-intelligence` → `pr-lifecycle`. sylph-gate's destructive-op classifier covers the `amend_of_pushed_head` pattern alongside force-push, filter-branch, and clean -fdx. ci-reader is driven by [plugins/ci-reader/state/ci-registry.json](plugins/ci-reader/state/ci-registry.json), which gates merge-queue entry and marks ArgoCD/WixieCD as read-only (not gating).

## Roadmap

Tracked in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and the shared [ecosystem map](docs/ecosystem.md). For upcoming work specific to Sylph, see issues tagged [roadmap](https://github.com/enchanter-ai/sylph/labels/roadmap). New host adapters, CI systems, and workflow classes are **not** breaking and land in minor releases; the ROADMAP captures engine-level changes.

## The Science Behind Sylph

| ID | Name | What it does | Algorithm |
|----|------|--------------|-----------|
| W1 | Myers-Diff Conventional Classifier | Drafts + validates Conventional Commits messages | Myers diff → rule-based classifier → LLM re-rank (Sonnet) + rules check (Haiku + Python) |
| W2 | Jaccard-Cosine Boundary Segmentation | Finds task boundaries in the edit stream | Online agglomerative clustering with multi-modal distance: α·(1−jaccard(files)) + β·(1−cosine(tokens)) + γ·tanh(idle/τ). α=β=0.4, γ=0.2, τ=300s, θ=0.55 |
| W3 | Workflow-Pattern Classifier | Detects GitHub Flow / Trunk-Based / GitFlow / Release Flow / Stacked Diffs | Weighted decision tree over branch-age distribution, protection rules, config-file markers, tag cadence. Per-subtree overrides via `.sylph/workflow-map.yaml` |
| W4 | Blame-Weighted Reviewer Ranker | Ranks reviewers for a PR | Weighted sum: `blame_score × recency_decay × path_depth × codeowners_boost × availability`. Blame score per path from `git log` (90-day half-life), depth weighting (deeper = higher priority), CODEOWNERS union boost (1.5×), availability filter. Top-3 cap — no review storms |
| W5 | Gauss Learning (Sylph) | Per-developer preference adaptation | Exponential moving averages (α=0.3) over commit style, slug style, reviewer overrides, W2 corrections. Bootstrap floor at 10 samples |

Every engine has a formal-algorithm-level name. "Smart commit helper" is not a name. "Myers-Diff Conventional Classifier" is.

---

## All 15 Workflows

Everything a team does with git/PR/CI — wired through real host + CI adapters.

### Commits & branching

- **`/sylph:commit`** — draft + validate + sign + commit staged changes
- **`/sylph:branch`** — create a branch named per the detected workflow
- **`/sylph:workflow-detect`** — show W3's classification + rationale
- **`/sylph:revert`** — safe revert via new commit (never rewrites history)

### Pull requests

- **`/sylph:pr`** — open or update a draft PR with W2-cluster body + W4 reviewers
- **`/sylph:status`** — aggregate view of branch + commits + PR + CI + reviewers + merge queue
- **`/sylph:reviewers`** — rank reviewers without assigning (useful for web-UI workflows)
- **`/sylph:merge`** — merge with strategy inferred from workflow, or enqueue on a merge queue
- **`/sylph:close`** — close a PR without merging (for abandoned / superseded work)
- **`/sylph:release`** — tag + changelog + handoff to semantic-release / release-please / changesets / goreleaser

### CI & safety

- **`/sylph:ci-status`** — aggregate CI status across every configured system
- **`/sylph:retry-ci`** — rerun failing checks (existing runs only — Sylph never triggers fresh builds)
- **`/sylph:dry-run`** — preview any git command through the destructive-op classifier without executing

### Learning

- **`/sylph:learnings`** — show W5 priors: commit style, slug style, reviewer overrides, W2 corrections

Every command has a markdown contract in `plugins/<name>/commands/*.md` — agents follow it; Claude Code dispatches the tools.

## 10 Git Hosts, All Real

No stubs. Every host has a full `HostAdapter` implementation. When credentials aren't configured, `is_authenticated()` returns False and ops raise `NotImplementedHostOp` cleanly — never silently fabricating a fake PR.

| Host | Transport | Auth | Status |
|------|-----------|------|--------|
| **GitHub** (Cloud + Enterprise) | urllib + gh fallback | `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` / git-credential-manager | Live-tested end-to-end |
| **GitLab** (SaaS + self-managed) | urllib | `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `GL_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Bitbucket Cloud** | urllib (REST 2.0) | `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Bitbucket Data Center** | urllib (REST 1.0, version-based PUTs) | `BITBUCKET_DC_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Azure DevOps** | urllib (Basic-wrapped PAT, api-version=7.1) | `AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN` / `VSTS_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Gitea** | urllib (GH-shape, `token` header) | `GITEA_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Forgejo** | urllib (subclass of Gitea) | `FORGEJO_TOKEN` / `GITEA_TOKEN` | Contract-tested |
| **Codeberg** | urllib (forgejo.codeberg.org) | `FORGEJO_TOKEN` / git-credential-manager | Contract-tested |
| **AWS CodeCommit** | `aws codecommit` CLI | AWS CLI config / IAM | Contract-tested |
| **SourceHut** | `git format-patch` + smtplib | SMTP / `git send-email` config | Contract-tested |

Every adapter follows the same contract: token resolution → authenticated request → normalized `PullRequest` return. The only structural difference is SourceHut, whose "PR" is an email thread to a mailing list — Sylph generates and sends the patch series; review happens in-list.

---

## 10 CI Systems, All Real

Same pattern: every CI adapter reads status via its native API (HTTP for most, `kubectl` for k8s-native). Returns a normalized `Check` list — empty when credentials/tooling are absent, never fabricated. Sylph reads CI; it never triggers builds.

| System | Transport | Gate-ready? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| GitHub Actions | urllib + gh (check-runs API) | Yes |
| GitLab CI | urllib (`/projects/:id/pipelines/:n/jobs`) | Yes |
| CircleCI | urllib (`Circle-Token` header) | Yes |
| Jenkins | urllib Basic auth, **treats UNSTABLE as failure** | Yes (with caveat) |
| Buildkite | urllib (SaaS control plane + agents) | Yes |
| Drone / Woodpecker | urllib (`/builds` or `/pipelines`) | Yes |
| Tekton | kubectl → PipelineRun CRDs | Yes (with kube access) |
| ArgoCD | kubectl → Application sync/health | Read-only (GitOps — drift surface) |
| WixieCD | kubectl → Kustomization Ready conditions | Read-only (GitOps) |

Jenkins gets its own note: **UNSTABLE is NOT success.** We learned that from the semantic-release / Jenkins incident where `status:SUCCESS` returned for a pipeline with `result:UNSTABLE` on a deploy stage. Sylph's Jenkins adapter requires `status == SUCCESS && result == SUCCESS` — anything else is non-green.

---

## The Decision-Gate Contract

Every destructive git operation routes through sylph-gate before it can run:

| Operation | Classification | Recovery window | Bypass |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `git push --force` | Destructive | 30d (remote reflog) | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git push --force-with-lease` to protected branch | **Protected-destructive** | 30d | **Never** |
| `git rebase -i <pushed-ref>` | Destructive | 90d (local reflog) | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git filter-branch` / `filter-repo` | Destructive | 90d local / permanent remote | `--yes-i-know` + 5s countdown |
| `git reset --hard <past-pushed>` | Destructive | 90d | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git branch -D <unmerged>` | Destructive | 90d | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git push --delete <branch>` | Destructive | host-dependent (GitHub: 14d) | `--yes-i-know` |
| `git tag -d` | Destructive | 90d local / permanent remote | `--yes-i-know` |
| **`git clean -fdx`** | **Protected-destructive** | **0 (irrecoverable)** | **Never** |
| Merge-queue `--admin` bypass | Destructive | 0 (immediate) | `--admin-bypass` flag only |

Every gated op is audited to `plugins/sylph-gate/state/audit.jsonl` — append-only, Emu-A4 atomic write.

Sylph isn't replacing git. It's **the layer above it** that you were building piece-by-piece in every project anyway.

## Agent Conduct (11 Modules)

Every skill inherits a reusable behavioral contract from [shared/conduct/](shared/conduct/) — loaded once into [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), applied across all plugins. This is how Claude *acts* inside Sylph: deterministic, surgical, verifiable. Not a suggestion; a contract.

| Module | What it governs |
|--------|-----------------|
| [discipline.md](shared/foundations/conduct/discipline.md) | Coding conduct: think-first, simplicity, surgical edits, goal-driven loops |
| [context.md](shared/foundations/conduct/context.md) | Attention-budget hygiene, U-curve placement, checkpoint protocol |
| [verification.md](shared/foundations/conduct/verification.md) | Independent checks, baseline snapshots, dry-run for destructive ops |
| [delegation.md](shared/foundations/conduct/delegation.md) | Subagent contracts, tool whitelisting, parallel vs. serial rules |
| [failure-modes.md](shared/foundations/conduct/failure-modes.md) | 14-code taxonomy for `state/learnings.json` so W5 Gauss Accumulation compounds |
| [tool-use.md](shared/foundations/conduct/tool-use.md) | Tool-choice hygiene, error payload contract, parallel-dispatch rules |
| [formatting.md](shared/foundations/conduct/formatting.md) | Per-target format (XML / Markdown sandwich / minimal / few-shot), prefill + stop sequences |
| [skill-authoring.md](shared/foundations/conduct/skill-authoring.md) | SKILL.md frontmatter discipline, discovery test |
| [hooks.md](shared/foundations/conduct/hooks.md) | Advisory-only hooks, injection over denial, fail-open |
| [precedent.md](shared/foundations/conduct/precedent.md) | Log self-observed failures to `state/precedent-log.md`; consult before risky steps |

## Testing

- **28 test assertions** passing (`bash tests/run-all.sh`) — unit, contract, and integration tiers. JSON validation, bash syntax check, Python functional smoke, end-to-end hook simulation.
- **1 live integration test** (`SYLPH_INTEGRATION=1 bash tests/run-all.sh`) — creates a real branch on `enchanter-ai/sylph`, opens a real draft PR via the urllib adapter path (no `gh` required), round-trips it via `get_pr`, closes it, deletes the branch. Proven against real GitHub.
- **Contract test for every host** (`tests/pr-lifecycle/test-all-hosts-contract.sh`) — asserts every one of the 10 adapters instantiates cleanly, reports a bool `is_authenticated`, and refuses to fabricate a PR when credentials are absent.
- **Honest numbers.** What's verified live: GitHub only. What's verified by contract: all 10 hosts + 10 CI systems. The README doesn't pretend otherwise. When you drop a GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure token in, you're using the same `_rest.api_request` call path that shipped through GitHub's real API. If something breaks there, it's in the per-host JSON shape, not the flow.

## Acknowledgments

Sylph builds on foundations laid by others:

- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** (Anthropic) — the plugin surface this work extends.
- **[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)** — CHANGELOG convention.
- **[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)** — versioning contract.
- **[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)** — Code of Conduct.
- **[repostatus.org](https://www.repostatus.org/)** — status badge.
- **[Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)** — citation metadata.
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — commit convention the W1 engine emits and Haiku validates.

W5 Gauss Learning shares the EMA update shape with Crow's H6 Session Learning (see [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) § H-suffix references) — aligned patterns across siblings, independent implementations.

## Versioning & release cadence

Sylph follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Breaking changes land on major bumps only; the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) flags them explicitly. Release cadence is opportunistic — tags land when accumulated fixes or features justify a cut, not on a fixed schedule. Changes to the `HostAdapter` contract, the W3 classifier labels, the `sylph-gate` destructive-op classification, or the W2/W5 ledger shapes **are** breaking; new adapters, CI systems, and workflow classes are **not**. Migration notes between majors live in [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). TL;DR: zero pip installs, honest scoring, per-sub-plugin structure identical, tests pass, no build-triggering code paths (Sylph reads CI; Sylph does not trigger builds).

## Role in the ecosystem

Sylph is the **git-workflow layer** — it coordinates branch / commit / PR / CI / merge across 10 git hosts and 10 CI systems. Upstream, it consumes signals from Wixie (commits emerge from Wixie-engineered sessions), Crow (trust-gaming gate pattern reused in sylph-gate; W4 reviewer availability borrows Crow's signal), and Lich (findings surfaced on the PR body at `/sylph:pr` time). Downstream, the W2 boundary-segmentation events feed Pech's per-task cost attribution.

Sylph does **not** trigger CI builds — Sylph is a git-workflow plugin, and CI execution belongs to your existing CI pipelines (push-triggered workflows, etc.). Sylph **reads** CI; it does not start it. Sylph also does not engineer prompts (Wixie), track tokens (Emu), score change trust (Crow), review code correctness (Lich), or scan security surfaces (Hydra).

See [docs/ecosystem.md § Data Flow Between Plugins](docs/ecosystem.md#data-flow-between-plugins) for the full map.
