## At a Glance

**8 sub-plugins. 5 algorithms (W1–W5). 5 agents. 6 hook bindings. 50 tests.**

Sylphs are silk-spinners — branches are threads, merges stitch them into a coherent history. Sylph covers the full git-flow arc: boundary detection → branch → commit → PR → CI observation → learning.

## Diagrams

| Diagram | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| High Level | [highlevel.mmd](highlevel.mmd) | 8 sub-plugins across SessionStart / PreToolUse / PostToolUse / PreCompact |
| Session Lifecycle | [lifecycle.mmd](lifecycle.mmd) | Load priors → gate destructive ops → segment → draft → push → observe |
| Data Flow | [dataflow.mmd](dataflow.mmd) | Cross-plugin events via enchanted-mcp event bus |
| Hook Bindings | [hooks.mmd](hooks.mmd) | Hook binding map with matchers and timeouts per sub-plugin |

## Algorithms (W1–W5)

| Code | Name | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| W1 | Myers-Diff Conventional Classifier | `shared/scripts/commit_classify.py` |
| W2 | Jaccard-Cosine Boundary Segmentation | `shared/scripts/boundary_segment.py` |
| W3 | Workflow-Pattern Classifier | `shared/scripts/workflow_detect.py` |
| W4 | Path-History Reviewer Routing | `shared/scripts/reviewer_route.py` |
| W5 | Gauss Learning (EMA Accumulation) | `shared/scripts/gauss_learning.py` |

Full derivations: [docs/science/README.md](../science/README.md).

## Agents

| Agent | Tier | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| commit-drafter | Sonnet | W1 Stage 1 — draft conventional-commit message from diff |
| message-validator | Haiku | W1 Stage 2 — validate spec + length + safe-amend |
| boundary-detector | Opus | W2 judgment on confidence-edge clusters (±0.10 band) |
| pr-description-crafter | Opus | W4 PR description from boundary cluster |
| conflict-resolver | Opus | W4 merge-conflict proposals |

## Execution Order

```
1. SessionStart
   ├─ capability-memory:   load provider registry, probe GitLab self-managed (10s)
   └─ sylph-learning:     load Gauss priors from learnings.json (5s)

2. PreToolUse (Bash)
   └─ sylph-gate:         classify destructive git ops, request confirmation (5s)

3. PostToolUse (Edit|Write|MultiEdit)
   └─ boundary-segmenter:  online clustering; fire boundary events (10s)

4. PreCompact
   ├─ boundary-segmenter:  checkpoint cluster state (5s)
   └─ sylph-learning:     persist EMA learnings (5s)

5. Event-driven (enchanted-mcp bus)
   ├─ branch-workflow:     auto-create branch on boundary event, per detected workflow
   ├─ commit-intelligence: draft conventional commit via W1 pipeline
   ├─ pr-lifecycle:        state machine — draft → ready → review → merge
   └─ ci-reader:           observe CI status across 8 systems, publish observations
```

## Quantifiable Assets

| Class | Count |
|-------|-------|
| Sub-plugins | 9 (+ `full` bundle) |
| Agents | 5 |
| Hook scripts | 6 |
| Shared script LOC | 5,300+ |
| Canonical commit types | 11 (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert) |
| Workflow classes | 6 (stacked-diffs, gitflow, release-flow, trunk-based, github-flow, unknown) |
| Git-host adapters | 9 (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Gitea, CodeCommit, SourceHut, Codeberg) |
| CI adapters | 8 (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, Buildkite, Drone, Tekton, ArgoCD) |
| Destructive-op rules | 14 (force-push, filter-branch, reset-hard, branch/remote/tag delete, etc.) |
| Tests | 30 |

## State Files

| `capability-registry.json` | capability-memory | Host capability probe results |
| `session-cache/` | pr-lifecycle, ci-reader | Adapter response cache |
