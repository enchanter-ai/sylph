# Enchanted Plugins Roadmap

**Vision:** Build the algorithm-driven operating system for AI-assisted development. 20 plugins connected through an MCP client, each backed by a named formal algorithm.

```

## Foundation Infrastructure

Before the first plugin ships, the ecosystem needs one shared piece: the repo template every sibling is cloned from.

| Repo | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| [`enchanter-ai/schematic`](https://github.com/enchanter-ai/schematic) | Canonical repo template. Ships the 8-section CLAUDE.md, 10 `shared/foundations/conduct/*.md` modules, `docs/architecture/` auto-generation pipeline, `plugins/example-subplugin/` skeleton, renderer toolchain. Never installed — cloned. | Shipped |

The template is the contract. When it drifts, all downstream siblings drift — so changes to `schematic` are treated as brand-standard changes, not per-plugin improvements.

---

## Phase 1: Core 5 Plugins (Foundation)

The first 5 plugins answer the 5 fundamental questions of AI-assisted development.

| # | Plugin | Question | Algorithms | Version | Status |
|---|--------|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Wixie** | What did I say? (prompt quality) | Gauss Convergence, Boolean SAT, Game Theory, Cross-Domain Adaptation | v3.0.0 | Shipped — 7 plugins |
| 2 | **Emu** | What did I spend? (token health) | Markov Drift, Shannon Compression, Linear Runway, Atomic Serialization | v2.0.0 | Shipped — 4 plugins |
| 3 | **Crow** | What just happened? (change comprehension) | Bayesian Trust, Semantic Diff, Information-Gain, Session Continuity | v1.0.0 | Shipped — 5 plugins |
| 4 | **Hydra** | Is it safe? (security) | Aho-Corasick, Shannon Entropy, Config Poisoning, Phantom Dependency, EMA Posture Decay | v1.0.0 | Shipped — 6 plugins |
| 5 | **Pech** | What did it cost? (spend tracking) | Exponential Smoothing, Budget Forecasting | — | Not started |

### Milestone: 5 plugins shipped
- Each plugin is a standalone Claude Code marketplace
- Each follows @enchanter-ai brand standard
- Each has named algorithms, managed agents, self-learning
- Users install individually: `/plugin marketplace add enchanter-ai/<name>`

---

## Phase 2: MCP Client POC (Unification)

Build `enchanted-mcp` — a Model Context Protocol client that connects all 5 plugins into a single orchestration layer.

### What the MCP Client Does

```
enchanted-mcp
├── Connects to all installed enchanter-ai via MCP
├── Unified dashboard: prompts + tokens + changes + security + costs
├── Cross-plugin intelligence:
│   ├── Wixie detects bad prompt → Emu shows token waste from it
│   ├── Crow flags risky change → Hydra scans it for vulnerabilities
│   ├── Pech shows cost spike → traces to which plugin/session caused it
│   └── All learnings shared across plugins (Gauss Accumulation network)
└── Single install: `npx enchanted-mcp` or Docker container
```

```

### Milestone: POC MCP client
- Connects to Wixie + Emu + Crow + Hydra + Pech
- Shared event bus for cross-plugin signals
- Basic web dashboard showing unified session view
- Cross-plugin learnings (Gauss Accumulation network)

## Phase 3: 10 Plugins (Full Coverage)

Add 5 more plugins covering code quality, testing, DevOps, documentation, and API design.

| # | Plugin | Question | Algorithm | Category |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 6 | **Athena** | Is this code good? | AST Diff + Weighted Decision Trees | Code review |
| 7 | **Crucible** | Do the tests catch bugs? | Genetic Mutation Testing | Testing/QA |
| 8 | **Scribe** | Is the docs up to date? | TF-IDF Extractive Summarization | Documentation |
| 9 | **Schema** | Is the API contract valid? | Semantic Version Diffing | API design |

### Milestone: 10 plugins + enhanced MCP
- All 10 plugins connected to enchanted-mcp
- Dashboard shows full development lifecycle
- Cross-plugin intelligence covers: prompt → code → test → security → deploy → docs
- Plugin-to-plugin event triggers (Crow flags change → Athena auto-reviews → Crucible tests)

### 15 More Plugins

| # | Plugin | Algorithm | Category |

## Naming Convention

Every plugin is named after a game entity that metaphorically describes its function.

| Plugin | Entity | Game | Why |
|--------|--------|------|-----|
| **Wixie** | Enchantment Orbs | Minecraft | XP orbs that power the enchantment table — enchanting prompts |
| **Emu** | Emu Mob | Minecraft | Flying creature that collects items and brings them to you — collecting tokens |
| **Crow** | Crow | Alex's Mobs | Silent watcher that observes every change, scores trust with a Bayesian eye, and flags what looks wrong — watching changes |
| **Hydra** | Hydra | Twilight Forest | Many-headed boss that regenerates and never truly dies — every secret scanning, vuln, and supply-chain check it survives makes it stronger |
| **Pech** | Pech | Thaumcraft | Small scholarly creature obsessed with counting and cataloguing every resource it touches — cost accounting |
| **Athena** | Athena | Hades | Goddess of wisdom who judges your combat quality and grants boons for excellence — code review |
| **Crucible** | Crucible | Terraria | Endgame crafting station forged in hellfire — tests things to destruction — mutation testing |
| **Sylph** | Sylph | Ars Nouveau | Airy nature spirit that weaves arcane threads into coherent flows — weaving branches, commits, and PRs into one history |

## Brand Standard (All Plugins)

Every @enchanter-ai product must:

1. Name every engine after a formal algorithm
2. Delegate background work to managed agents (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
3. Persist learning across sessions (Gauss Accumulation)
4. Report honest numbers — never inflate claims
5. Use atomic operations and handle race conditions
6. Maintain zero external dependencies (bash + jq for hooks, Python stdlib for scripts)
7. Include tests, dark-themed PDF reports, and comprehensive documentation
8. Follow the Emu-style plugin marketplace structure
